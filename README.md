The image depicts a basic structure of a neural network used for image classification, specifically for identifying different types of fish. Here's a detailed explanation:

Neural Network Structure
Input Layer:

The image of a fish, in this case, a goldfish, is fed into the neural network.
The pixels of the image are used as the input data. Each pixel value is a feature that the network will use to learn and make predictions.
Hidden Layers:

The network contains multiple hidden layers. These layers consist of interconnected neurons.
Each neuron in a hidden layer takes input from the neurons in the previous layer, processes it, and passes the output to the neurons in the next layer.
The connections between neurons are weighted, and these weights are adjusted during the training process to minimize the error in predictions.
Output Layer:

The output layer consists of neurons corresponding to the possible classes the network can predict. In this example, there are three classes: Gold Fish, Indian Carp, and Goby.
Each neuron in the output layer represents the probability of the input image belonging to a particular class.
Workflow
Image Input:

The process starts with an image of a fish being input into the network.
The image is broken down into its pixel values which are then fed into the input layer.
Data Processing:

As the data moves through the hidden layers, various features and patterns within the image are detected and learned.
The neurons in each hidden layer apply an activation function to the weighted sum of their inputs, introducing non-linearity into the model, which helps in learning complex patterns.
Classification:

The processed data reaches the output layer, where each neuron provides a score or probability for a respective class.
The class with the highest probability is chosen as the prediction of the neural network.

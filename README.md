# Identification-of-Fish-Species
The image depicts a basic structure of a neural network used for image classification, specifically for identifying different types of fish. Here's a detailed explanation. <br></br>

**Neural Network Structure**
**1.Input Layer:** <BR>
The image of a fish, in this case, a goldfish, is fed into the neural network. The pixels of the image are used as the input data. Each pixel value is a feature that the network will use to learn and make predictions. <BR>
**2.Hidden Layers:** <BR>
The network contains multiple hidden layers. These layers consist of interconnected neurons.Each neuron in a hidden layer takes input from the neurons in the previous layer, processes it, and passes the output to the neurons in the next layer. The connections between neurons are weighted, and these weights are adjusted during the training process to minimize the error in predictions.
<BR>
**3.Output Layer:** <BR>
The output layer consists of neurons corresponding to the possible classes the network can predict. In this example, there are three classes: Gold Fish, Indian Carp, and Goby.Each neuron in the output layer represents the probability of the input image belonging to a particular class.

**User Interface**
The interface is designed to be highly accessible and functional:<BR>
<ol>
<li>Sidebar with Fish Species List: The sidebar contains a scrollable list of fish species that the model can recognize, each accompanied by an icon for easy identification.</li>
<li>Upload and Capture Options: Users can select to upload an image file or capture a new image using their device's camera.</li>
<li>Drag-and-Drop Upload Area: A dedicated area where users can drag and drop image files for classification.</li>
<li>Image Upload Limitations: Clearly states the file size limit and supported formats to ensure users provide compatible images.</li>
</ol>
